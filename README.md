Completing the coding test over BigCommerce using the Stencil CLI was kind of a challenging and rewarding experience. I can say that there is a lot of learning involved, as you familiarize yourself with the BigCommerce platform and its development tools. In my experience, I spent a lot of time trying to send and receive a response from the V2/V3 API, but ran into issues with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing). Despite some early challenges, I feel confident that I could learn to master BigCommerce development with more practice and experience.
